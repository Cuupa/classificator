## About this project

This project is a simple classification engine written in Kotlin and using Spring Boot as a framework.

This project is provided via the MIT-licence, which is free of charge. But if you want to support me, you can spend me a
beer or a coffee. If you want to participate, feel free to create pull requests, fork this project or hit me up with
suggestions or code reviews.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS and done in my spare time.

"I want to participate, but I know nothing about programming ðŸ˜”"
- No problem. You can contribute by
  providing [topic definitions](https://github.com/Cuupa/classificator/tree/master/knowledgebase) or contribute by
  providing feedback, make some suggestions eg. If you want to contribute to your topic, open a new issue providing your
  suggested changes but also supply any text you have tested with. If you want to create or fine tune a topic, create a
  pull request and I'll give it a shot.

## How it works

Currently it is just a keyword classification engine with some tweaks. It uses the levensthein algorithm to counter
spelling or OCR errors.

It tries to match the topics, sender and metadata, provided in the 7zip archive in "knowledgebase/kb-{version
number}.db". If no sender matches, it tries to determine the sender via REGEX, removing the ones with more then six
words, counting the occurences in the text and taking the occurences times the length of the String.

There is a simple test GUI at http://addressofyour.server/

Currently I'm working on lemmatizing and different languages.
