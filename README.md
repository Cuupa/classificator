## How it works
Currently it is just a keyword classification engine with some tweaks. It uses the levensthein algorithm to counter spelling or OCR errors.

It tries to match the topics, sender and metadata, provided in "src/main/resources/kbfiles".

If no sender matches, it tries to determine the sender via REGEX, removing the ones with more then six words, counting the occurences in the text and taking the occurences times the length of the String.

Currently I'm working on lemmatizing and different languages.
