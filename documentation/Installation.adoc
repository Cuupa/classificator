== Installation

=== Windows/Unix
Since it is a simple .jar file, which can run on any device
featuring link:https://www.java.com/de/download/manual.jsp[Java], you can run it by simply doubleclicking.

TIP: Be aware of
the link:https://github.com/Cuupa/classificator/tree/master/src/main/resources/application.yml[application configuration].

The default port as in said configuration is `8080`
[source,yaml]
----
server_port: 8080

----
So if you want to access the webUI on your local machine navigate to `https://localhost:8080`

[source,yaml]
----
knowlegde_base: build/knowledgebase

----
=== Docker

==== Dockerfile
If you can use a dockerfile, you can create one like this:
Note to self: Need to test this!

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM openjdk:15-jdk
MAINTAINER Cuupa
WORKDIR /opt/app/classificator
COPY knowlegebase/kb-1.0.0.db ./knowledgebase/kb-1.0.0.db
COPY *.jar ./app.jar

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "./app.jar", "--server.port=8080", "--knowlegde_base=./knowlegebase/kb-1.0.0.db"]
----

Please change the port of the application and change it accordingly.

==== Synology NAS
. Create yourself a folder, where you upload the files to +

. Give this container a name to your likings and click on the 'Advanced Settings' button +

. Mount your folders and files to the docker container. It is also a good idea to change this to "read only" mode, as
this program does not change these files +

. Change the ports to your liking +

. Go to the environment tab and paste this as command to run: +
[source,shell]
----
java -jar /opt/classificator/app.jar '--server.port=8081' '--knowlegde_base=/opt/classificator/knowledgebase'
----

Finally, run this container. You can access the webui by going to `http://your-nas-ip:your-port` For
example `http://192.168.0.3:8081`
