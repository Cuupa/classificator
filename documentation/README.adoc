== Installation

=== Windows/Unix
Since it is a simple .jar file, which can run on any device
featuring link:https://www.java.com/de/download/manual.jsp[Java], you can run it by simply doubleclicking.

TIP: Be aware of
the link:https://github.com/Cuupa/classificator/tree/master/src/main/resources/application.yml[application configuration].

The default port as in said configuration is `8080`
[source,yaml]
----
server_port: 8080

----
So if you want to access the webUI on your local machine navigate to `https://localhost:8080`

[source,yaml]
----
knowlegde_base: build/knowledgebase

----
=== Docker

==== Dockerfile
If you can use a dockerfile, you can create one like this:
Note to self: Need to test this!

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM openjdk:15-jdk
MAINTAINER Cuupa
WORKDIR /opt/app/classificator
COPY knowlegebase/kb-1.0.0.db ./knowledgebase/kb-1.0.0.db
COPY *.jar ./app.jar

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "./app.jar", "--server.port=8080", "--knowlegde_base=./knowlegebase/kb-1.0.0.db"]
----

Please change the port of the application and change it accordingly.

==== Synology NAS
. Create yourself a folder, where you upload the files to +
image:https://github.com/Cuupa/classificator/blob/master/documentation/images/docker-classificator.png[folder]

. Download the openJDK container +
image:https://github.com/Cuupa/classificator/blob/master/documentation/images/open_jdk_download.png[openjdk]

. Create a new container from this image +
image:https://github.com/Cuupa/classificator/blob/master/documentation/images/docker_new_container_1.png[new container_1]

. Give this container a name to your likings and click on the 'Advanced Settings' button +
image:https://github.com/Cuupa/classificator/blob/master/documentation/images/docker_new_container_2.png[new_container_2]

. Mount your folders and files to the docker container. It is also a good idea to change this to "read only" mode, as
this program does not change these files +

. Change the ports to your liking +
image:https://github.com/Cuupa/classificator/blob/master/documentation/images/docker_ports.png[ports]

. Go to the environment tab and paste this as command to run: +
[source,shell]
----
java -jar /opt/classificator/app.jar '--server.port=8081' '--knowlegde_base=/opt/classificator/knowledgebase'
----

Finally, run this container. You can access the webui by going to `http://your-nas-ip:your-port` For
example `http://192.168.0.3:8081`

== Configuration

This is the default configuration of the application
It sets the server port to 8080 and the knowledgebase-directory to `build/knowledgebase`

[source,yaml]
----
server_port: 8080
knowlegde_base: build/knowledgebase

server.port: ${server_port}

logging.level:
  root: ERROR
  com.cuupa.classificator: WARN

classificator:
  kbfiles: ${knowlegde_base}

  monitor:
    enabled: true
    logText: true
    database-name: "monitor.db"
----

=== Server port
The default port as in said configuration is `8080`
So if you want to access the webUI on your local machine navigate to `https://localhost:8080`
[source,yaml]
----
server_port: 8080

----

=== Knowledgebase
This entry means, that there has to be a folder named `build/knowlegebase` beside your jar file. You can specify which
knowledgebase to use, by changing it via the command line arguments (How that works will be covered by me
a https://github.com/Cuupa/classificator#Changing-the-configuration[few lines down below]). If this entry only
contains a folder name without the specific knowlegedbase, it will load the file with the highest version tag in that
folder
[source,yaml]
----
knowlegde_base: build/knowledgebase

----

=== Monitor
The monitor is enabled by default and uses the database `monitor.db`
[source,yaml]
----
 monitor:
    enabled: true
    logText: true
    database-name: "monitor.db"

----

If `enabled` is set to `true`, all events will be logged. To turn it off, set it to `false`.
If `logText` is enabled, the actual analyzed texts will be logged into the database. You might want to turn it off for privacy reasons

==== Database name
The database name is defined via `database-name`. You can change it to your likings. It uses relative paths by default. If you want to use absolute paths, change it to
[source,yaml]
----
database-name: "C:\Users\John Doe\monitor.db"
----

=== Changing
==== Via config
If you know about programming: Great! You can change it as you like for example
[source,yaml]
----
knowlegde_base: knowledgebase/kb-1.0.0.db
----

or

[source,yaml]
----
server_port: 1234
----

==== Via command line arguments
If you don't, don't panic. You can run the application by typing

[source,shell]
----
java -jar app.jar --server_port=8080 --knowledge_base=knowlegebase/kb-1.0.0.db --classificator.monitor.logText=false
----

The first part simply runs the jar by the name "app.jar"
[source,shell]
----
java -jar app.jar
----

This part sets the port to 8080 and overwrites the value of the default configuration
[source,shell]
----
--server_port=8080
----

This part sets the location of the knowledgebase. You can use relative paths like
[source,shell]
----
--knowledge_base=knowlegebase/kb-1.0.0.db
----

or absolute paths like
[source,shell]
----
--knowledge_base="C:\Users\John Doe\knowlegebase\kb-1.0.0.db"
----
Notice that, you need to quote the value as soon as you have spaces in a parameter
